# Division by Zero Exception in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: division by zero. The provided assembly code attempts to divide a value by the contents of the DX register. If DX is zero, a division-by-zero exception occurs, leading to program termination.

A solution is provided that includes a check for zero before performing the division, preventing the exception.
